# Project-01: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for MTA Turnstile Data:
This is the first project for the Metis Data Science Bootcamp, where we perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the MTA turnstiles data.

The target market are commuters who use the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) system since commuters are highly likely to use citibike in the morning to go to their office. In order to increase the user base, advertisements would be posted in high-traffic MTA stations. Users would then be sent push notifications from the app to prompt them to get daily, three-day, and annual passes citibike or renew their subscriptions, making Citi Bike a great option for commuters and locals alike.
